# An Artificial Neural Network Library in C

TinY ANN is a simple library to create neural networks in C for smaller data science projects. This project was made
to make it easier to implement neural networks on Arduinos and in C language for other projects. 

## 1. Example Codes

There are 6 example codes in this repository. In these examples I show how to use the library, how to create neural networks, and how to train them. There are three 

### 1.1 Graphical Examples

#### 1.1.1 Grahical Visualization using SDL2

You'll need to have SDL2 in order to try out these example codes.

#### 1.1.2 Plot Gallery

On the image below you can see some of the most beautiful plots. The dots mark the training dataset and the colors show how the neural net learned to classify this two dimensional dataset.
